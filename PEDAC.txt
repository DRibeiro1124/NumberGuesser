Explorer Mode

-Display some sort of greeting to describe the game or challenge.
    "Hello, if you think of a number between x and y, I can guess your number in z tries.

-Ask the challenger for their name and to think of a number between 1 and 1024.
    " Hi, what's your name?"
    "Think of a number between 1 and 1024, but remember, do not tell me the number"

-Don't get the number from the user, you need to guess the number

-Guess a number and ask the user if the number you guessed is higher or lower to the number they are thinking of.
    "Is your number higher or lower than x?"
    Depending on the answer, apply Algorithm 
    
-Keep trying until you guess the number correctly.

Adventure Mode

-Allow the user to choose the maximum number for their range.

-Tell them the most number of guesses your code will need!

-Prompt the user to play again at the end of the game.


Algorithm

1- Get a greeting out to the player and explain the guessing game.
2- The user gets to pick a number (in their head) between 0 and 1024.
3- Tell the user you'll be able to guess that number in 10 tries or less.
4- For the max value (1024), we have to divide that by 2 and get 512. 
    Ask the user if their number is higher or lower than 512.
5- If their number is higher, you know it's between 513 and 1024, or if it's 
    lower, it's between 1 and 511.
6- Create a loop depending on the response from user in line 5.
7- Once you guessed the number, prompt a phrase saying you have guessed 
    their number in x amount of guesses.
8- Ask if they want to try again.


 static string PromptForString(string prompt)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(prompt);
                var userInput = Console.ReadLine();
                return userInput;
            }

            static void GameGreeting()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("----------------------------------");
                Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Number Guesser Game");
                Console.WriteLine("----------------------------------");
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine();
                var name = PromptForString("What is your name?");

                Console.WriteLine(($"Hello {name}! Think of a number between 1 and 1024. DO NOT TELL ME YOUR NUMBER!! I'll try to guess it correctly in 10 tries or less"));

            }
